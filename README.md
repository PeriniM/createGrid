# What is it?
createGrid() is a one-page application that lets you create elements with vertices fixed on a squared grid. You can export the whole grid in one svg file or just separated elements. You could also export the vertices of each element as an array.

# Why?
To quickly generate grid elements which can be used for repetitive patterns. Main applications can be found on the analysis of new grids for Finite Element Methods (FEM) or Virtual Element Methods (VEM) algorithms.
